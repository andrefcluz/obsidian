## üìö PickMate ‚Äî Random Discovery App (Books, Future Expansion)

### Concept

**PickMate** is a lightweight, cross-platform mobile app that helps users discover new content in a fun, effortless way.  
Starting with books, users select a **category** (e.g., Fantasy, Romance, Mystery) and are presented with a **random, highly-rated title** ‚Äî complete with cover, description, rating, and a link to buy on **Amazon (affiliate link)**.

The core appeal: **eliminate choice fatigue**, make discovery playful, and reward users with surprises ‚Äî one random pick at a time.

**Long-term vision:** expand beyond books to movies, TV shows, podcasts, and other content types using the same random-selection mechanic.
