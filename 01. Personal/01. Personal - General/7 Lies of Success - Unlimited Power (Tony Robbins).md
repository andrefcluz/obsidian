1. **Everything happens for a purpose, and serves us**

Successful people have the mysterious ability to focus on the possibilities in any given situation. They think in terms of possibilities. They believe that every adversity, every failure carries within itself the seed of an equal or greater benefit.

We will always face setbacks as we fight for our goals and dreams. Think of how powerful you will be if you adopt the belief that every event happens for a purpose and is meant to serve you!

2. **There is no such thing as failure, only results**

Successful people do not believe in failure. Failure does not exist… for them. They always succeed in getting some sort of results. If they do something that doesn’t bring about the desired outcome, they see that as a learning experience. As feedback. They try something new that brings some new, different results. It is a never ending process of action and reaction, adjustments and corrections.

3. **Whatever happens, take responsibility**

Take responsibility for whatever happens. Successful people operate from the belief that they create their world. When you believe that you create what happens, good or bad, you start to feel empowered. If you don’t believe you create your world you are at the mercy of circumstances. By taking responsibility you have the power to change the results you bring about. There is nothing more liberating than when you come to the realization that you are in control of your world.

4. **You don’t need to understand everything, to use everything**

Successful people don’t believe they need to know everything about something in order to use it. They use what is essential without get dragged down into every detail. Successful people know what is essential to understand and what is not, and utilizatize all resources to their advantage. Successful people are exceptionally good at discerning what is important to them and what is not.

5. **People are your greatest resource**

Respect and appreciation for people is a universal quality that all achievers share. They have team spirit, a sense of unity and common goals. Successful leaders all understand that the success of their business all depends on their people.

6. **Work is play**

Do you know anyone who has achieved immens success by doing something s/he hates? A key to success is a happy marriage between what you do and what you love. Don’t waste your life away by doing something you hate. Find something you truly enjoy and you will find success.

7. **There is no success without commitment**

People who succeed believe in the power of commitment. Successful people are willing to do whatever it takes to succeed [without harming others]. That distinguishes them from the majority. Don’t be a ‘try-baby’. When someone says that they will try, you know that they won’t get it done. ‘Try’ is just a front end excuse. Commit to your goals and don’t give until you reach them.
