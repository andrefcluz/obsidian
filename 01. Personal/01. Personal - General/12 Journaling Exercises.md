## 10x Journaling Exercise

1. **Take a measurable goal and multiply it by 10**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Measurable goal | Measurable goal x10 |
| Fazer 500€ extra por mês | Fazer 5.000€ extra por mês |

1. **Answer the following question until you can't come up with any more answers:**

If someone had successfully achieved this goal, what would they've had to do in order to achieve it?

List their actions, habits, mindset, but also other factors and milestones that could've led to the result.

- Trabalhar apenas jogos de equipas bem conhecidas.
- Trabalhar jogos com muita liquidez.
- Trabalhar jogos com uma boa stream, com pouco delay.
- Trabalhar os jogos sem distrações e com altos níveis de energia e concentração.

1. **Ask yourself:**
What is currently stopping me from doing the same?
If there is something stopping you, how can you overcome it?

## Casting a Vision

- **Ask yourself: What would my ideal life look like in X years?** You can also write a diary entry describing the perfect day in your ideal life.
- **Don’t be “realistic” or think about HOW you would get there.** Trust that there is a way, and you’ll figure it out eventually.
- **Describe it in as much detail as possible** - the clearer you are, the easier it is to achieve.
- **Cover each area of your life** - your career or business, health & body, relationships, finances, mindset & happiness etc.

## Narrowing Focus

1. **Write out your goal.**

2. **Make a list of all the things that you could do to achieve your specific goal.**

3. **Narrow the focus to the most important thing by asking yourself:**

    - What's the one thing I can do that will make everything else easier or unnecessary?
    - What's the one thing I can do that makes everything else fall into place?

4. **Determine one single thing that is most important and prioritize it by scheduling it on your calendar.**

## Overcoming Procrastination

1. **Ask yourself: Why am I procrastinating?**
**
**
2. **Write down all the thoughts that come up.**

Don't stop at "I'm lazy". Dig deeper with every thought that comes up to find the real reasons that are holding you back.

1. **Create absolute clarity.**

Find out if your reasons for procrastinating are accurate by asking questions like:

    - What are all the steps I need to take from start to finish to get it done? Does this still feel overwhelming or do I need to chunk it down even more? Is there a way to make it even easier and simpler?
    - Am I really lacking the skills to confidently approach this? What are they? Or am I just afraid of not doing it perfectly?
    - What's the worst thing that can happen if I fail? Is it really that bad?
    - Am I genuanely motivated by my goal? Or is it actually not motivating to me and I'm just doing it for other reasons (e.g. to impress others, because my parents want me to etc.)?
    - Am I afraid of succeeding at it because what comes after is even more challenging?
    - Is there anything else that's holding me back from starting this project?

2. **Make an action plan.**

Determine how you will address the reasons for your procrastination. Schedule the first action you're going to take on your calend, ideally first thing in the morning before doing anything else.

## Dropping Limiting Beliefs

1. **Identify and write down your limiting belief.**
Ask yourself:

    - What beliefs do I currently have that are holding me back from achieving my goal/being happier/having more confidence?
    - What are my beliefs around...
        - ...my ability to achieve my goal/find a partner/make friends?
        - ...my own self-worth?

1. **Create unbearable pain in the past, present, and future for having this belief.**

Ask yourself:

    - What has this belief cost me in the past, and how has it negatively affected people I've loved in the past? What have I lost because of it?
    - What is it costing me and people I care about in the present?
    - What will it cost me and people I care about one, three, five, and 10 years from now?

As you write down your answers, visualize it in your mind and intensely feel the emotion associated with it to get your subconscious mind to experience it too.

1. **Question your limiting belief.**

Once you have listed all the negative consequences of your limiting belief, question it.

Ask yourself:

    - Is this belief really true?
    - Is it accurate?
    - Is this just a story that I've been telling myself?

If you still believe deep down that it's true, start again from the beginning and create more pain.

1. **Replace it with a new, empowering belief.**
Ask yourself:

    - What is an empowering belief that I can replace my old limiting belief with?

## Einstein Problem Solving

1. **Write out the problem you're facing.**
2. **Clearly define the problem by considering the following:**

    - What would someone else identify as the problem?
    - What would be the opposite of this particular problem?
    - Break the problem down into their single parts.
    - Identify and challenge underlying assumptions.

3. **Identity the one single root of the problem and how you can solve it.**

## Mental Windshield Wipers

- **Write down everything that you're currently thinking and feeling.**
- **Don't filter it, don't try to be eloquent, don't even worry about your grammar. Write it how it appears in your mind - messy, unorganized and honest.**
- **Keep writing until every thought has been captured on paper. If a new thought comes up, capture that one too until your mind is completely silent.**

## Unbreakable Habit System

1. **Optimize triggers:**

What is triggering or tempting me to do the bad habits, and how can I remove them?

What triggers can I set up that remind me to do the good habit?

1. **Optimize routines:**
What obstacles can I set up that make it harder for me to do the bad habit?

What obstacles can I remove that makes it easier for me to stick to the good habit?

1. **Optimize consequences:**

What negative consequences can I set up that make it a horrible experience to continue with the bad habit or not to follow through with the  good habit?

What rewards can I set up that would make me look forward to sticking to my good habit?

## First-Principles Thinking

- **Write down the assumption that you or others make.**

- **Clarify your thinking and explain the origins of your ideas.**

Ask yourself: Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?

- **Break it down.**

Ask yourself: What are the most fundamental truths I can come up with without making any assumptions? What are the core parts?

- **Challenge each assumption as wrong until proven right.**

Ask yourself: How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite? What can I prove only based on analogy, opinion or the past, and therefore it is an assumption?

- **Look for evidence.**

Ask yourself: How can I back this up? What are the sources?

- **Consider alternative perspectives.**

Ask yourself: What might others think? How do I know I am correct?

- **Consider relationships between them.**

Ask yourself: How do these core components relate to each other? What is their sequence?

- **Ask why five times.**

To get to the core of a problem, you can ask why something is true five times in a row until you get to a reasonable conclusion.

- **Write down your reexamined line of reasoning.**

## Finding Your Passion

- As a child, you were already in your zone of genius before society put expectations on you. Ask yourself the following questions and answer without filtering out anything you judge as being not useful:
